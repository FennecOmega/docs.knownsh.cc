A simple unofficial addon for [Figura](https://modrinth.com/mod/figura) that allows Simple Voice Chat to be detected by Figura Lua scripts. \
**This works without any serverside code or mods.**

## The Basics
This mod is built to be **as simple as possible**, the mod introduces only one new event to Figura, which you can declare in your Lua script like so:

<Aside type="danger">
    Don't use the following code example on a multiplayer server! \
    **This is only shown for explanation purposes.**
</Aside>

```lua
events["svc.microphone"] = function()
    -- code (unsafe on servers) (client only)
end
```

This `svc.microphone` event is triggered each gametick that the client has their microphone active.


## Multiplayer Compatibility

<Aside type="tip">
    Because FiguraSVC is completely clientside *(and works via pings)*, neither the server or any other player needs to have it installed for it to work!
</Aside>

To ensure compatibility and avoid potential issues when using FiguraSVC in a multiplayer setting, it is recommended to wrap the event in a mod check. This way, you can verify if the mod is loaded before executing the event:
```lua
if client:isModLoaded("figurasvc") then
    events["svc.microphone"] = function ()
        -- code (safe on servers) (client only)
    end
end
```
While the above works on the clientside, other players on a server **won't see anything when the event is called**. To make anything *(i.e. talking animations)* visible to all other players, you can utilize the following code snippet:
```lua
-- Example talking animation
local microphoneOffTime = 0
local isMicrophoneOn = false

function pings.talking(state)
    -- (safe on servers) (visible to everyone)
    animations.model.talk:setPlaying(state)
end

function events.tick()
    local previousMicState = isMicrophoneOn
    
    microphoneOffTime = microphoneOffTime + 1
    isMicrophoneOn = microphoneOffTime <= 2 -- has svc.microphone been called in the past 2 ticks?
  
    if previousMicState ~= isMicrophoneOn then
        pings.talking(isMicrophoneOn)
    end
end

if client:isModLoaded("figurasvc") and host:isHost() then
    events["svc.microphone"] = function ()
        microphoneOffTime = 0
    end
end
```
In this example, the pings.talking function is used to trigger an animation when the microphone state changes, ensuring that it is visible to all players.
